                    Working within a team is a fun and learning experience. Here are two projects I worked
                    on with a few of my classmates.
                    <a href="https://github.com/TwistedNeon/Group-Project-1">Group Project 1</a>
                    <a href="https://github.com/ucr-the-boyz/group-project-2.github.io">Group Project 2</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Javascript is the root of my skills. In my password generator project, I use Javascript
                    to provide a user with an unique password based on a few selections.
                    <a href="https://github.com/jeremivh123/password-gen">Password Generator</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with APIs is something I also have practice in. In my <a href="https://github.com/jeremivh123/weatherapp.github.io">Weather App</a>
                     project, I pull data from an outside source to use in my app.

                    In my <a href="https://github.com/jeremivh123/employeeTracker">Employee Tracker</a>
                     project, I use node as a server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my <a href="https://github.com/jeremivh123/burger">Burger App</a> project, I put all my skills together to build
                    a fun and interactive application.
